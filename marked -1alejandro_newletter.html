<p>Ottawa | October 01, 2015</p>

<p> Sets $2.6 million goal for this year's campaign</p>

<p>From October 1 to 23, 2015, all 395 Walmart Canada stores will be supporting families in need by raising money for Canadian Red Cross in support of its disaster relief and emergency preparedness activities across the country.</p>

<p>Beginning on Thursday, October 1, Walmart Canada customers are invited to contribute to the invaluable humanitarian work the Red Cross accomplishes in Canada. Each store will match customer contributions to a maximum of $2,000.</p>

<p>Since 2003, Walmart Canada has raised and donated nearly $29 million in disaster relief funding. Last year, the company raised and donated over $2.8 million for the Canadian Red Cross. These funds provided support to flood relief operations in Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan as well as close to 3,000 responses to provide relief to families affected by house fires and pre-emptive evacuations. Although they often fail to make the news, these personal disasters disrupt thousands of lives every year. Every penny counts. Walmart customers can make a real difference in their community and in the lives of local families by donating at their local Walmart.</p></td>

<p>Funds raised during Walmart Canada's annual Red Cross Campaign are set aside to help local families after disaster strikes in their respective communities. Donations support the distribution of essential emergency supplies, hot meals, new clothing and a safe place to stay for those affected, as well as training and equipment for local volunteer teams.</p>

<p>For the past 12 years, Walmart Canada has supported Red Cross operations in communities across Canada, making them stronger and more resilient in their response to disaster,” said Conrad Sauve, president and CEO of the Canadian Red Cross. Walmart Canada is a major partner, and our relationship is one of the largest partnerships within the worldwide Red Cross Movement and all its national Societies.</p>

<p>proud to support the Canadian Red Cross and bring awareness about disaster preparedness to local communities, said Erin Mackey, Manager, Community Giving, Walmart Canada. We take great pride in serving the communities where we operate, and are honoured to help ensure they have the support they need, when they need it most.</p>
